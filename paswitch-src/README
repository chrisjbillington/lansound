paswitch is a simple commandline utility for changing the PulseAudio sink for
all applications, in much the same way GNOME "Sound preferences" dialog
does it.

"pacmd set-default-sink" alone is not sufficient since PulseAudio daemon
keeps persistant settings for applications and this default only gets used
for applications that the daemon have not yet seen.



Compiling
=========

To compile:

 $ make

You need "libpulse-dev" installed.

If your system stores headers and/or libraries in an unusual place you
might need to adjust the gcc command line in the Makefile.



Using
=====

To get a list of sinks on your system:

 $ pactl list

Look for lines that look like this:

Sink #0
        State: SUSPENDED
        Name: alsa_output.pci-0000_01_00.1.hdmi-stereo
	      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to supply this name to paswitch:

 $ paswitch alsa_output.pci-0000_01_00.1.hdmi-stereo
